# Functions-Assignment C++ Template

This is the start of your assignment in writing functions for C++. As written, main.cpp will fail to compile.

After fixing the code per the instructions on Canvas, compile and run main.cpp using the following command:
```
g++ main.cpp -o ./main.o && ./main.o
```

Feel free to change this README if you'd like!
